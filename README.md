Vampy's Bay Art Counter is a web-based shell calculator for your bayfox art submissions!
It helps save time and has the potential to make art submission a bit more accessible.
Please let me know if you run into any bugs, or have a suggestion for how to improve the tool!

By the way, you are 100% ALLOWED to use any and all code from this project to make art point counters for other art RPGs!
All of the math for point calculations is in "shellcounter.js", helper methods are mostly in "arthelper.js", and the main functionality of the site is in "artmanager.js".

Thank you and have a good one!
